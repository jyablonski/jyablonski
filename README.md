# Hi there üëã

I'm Jacob, a Data Engineer based in Southern California specializing in building scalable data platforms and cloud infrastructure. I'm passionate about applying software engineering best practices to data systems - CI/CD, IaC, automated testing, and clean architecture. I also enjoy working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.
